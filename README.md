Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm 25 years old and currently studying Computer Science at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA). Iâ€™m also a Fullstack Developer with experience using frameworks such as Bootstrap, Django, and Flask. Recently, I completed a QA Manual Tester course, where I gained knowledge in creating test cases, reporting bugs, and software quality control.

This is where I share my coding journey, projects, and a little piece of my passion for technology. Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just want to connect.
